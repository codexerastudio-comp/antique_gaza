# antique_gaza
This project is an educational and documentation mobile application aimed at highlighting the significant historical and archaeological sites within the Gaza Strip and its various governorates. The app is designed to serve as a user guide, informing them about these treasures and locating them geographically.

🎯 Key Goals and Features:
1.Comprehensive Introductory Information:
The "What is Gaza?" screen (What is Gaza?) provides historical and geographical details about Gaza City, noting its significance as an important crossing point between the East and West, and its status as one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world.

2.Navigation by Governorate and Site:
The "City Screen" allows browsing archaeological areas within each governorate (e.g., Deir al-Balah - دير البلح).
It lists specific sites such as Tell al-Raqish (تل الرقيش), Deir al-Balah Cemetery (مقبرة دير البلح), and Maqam al-Khader (مقام الخضر).

3.Mapping and Geographical Location:
The "Gaza Map Screen" (Map Gaza Screen) displays a schematic map of the Gaza Strip, showing its key cities and governorates (e.g., Beit Lahia, Rafah, Khan Yunis).
The "Map Screen" (Map Screen) shows the precise geographical location of a selected landmark, such as Tell al-Raqish.
The "Place Screen" (Place Screen) provides detailed information about an archaeological site, confirming that the solution was to create an app that uses GPS coordinates to show archaeological sites on a map.
The site details include a button to "Go to Map" (انتقل إلى الخريطة).

4.Content Management (Admin Feature):
The "Add Place Screen" (Add place screen) enables the addition of new locations, including selecting the governorate, the place name, and details about the place.

5.Utility Features:
A side drawer menu (Drawer) facilitates navigation to Home, "What is Gaza?", "About The App", and includes a Language change option.
The application includes a branded Splash Screen.
